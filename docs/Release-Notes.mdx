# Ziggurat Release Notes
---

## Features added in 3.2.0
1. The following changes have been made to improve exponential retries, which is an experimental feature.
     * Retry type configuration has been introduced for both, channel retry-flow and normal retry flow. A retry type can take of these values: [:linear :exponential]
     * Defines a limit of 25 on number of retries in exponential backoff
     * Channels can have different values of :queue-timeout-ms, which controls the expiration time in the delay queue. 
2. Fixes this [bug](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat/issues/133) where dead set replay broke on Ziggurat upgrade from 2.x to 3.x
3. Fixes this [bug](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat/issues/136) where dead-set replay doesn't send the message to the retry-flow
4. Fixes this [bug](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat/issues/115) in RabbitMQ message processing flow
5. Fixes this [issue](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat/issues/129) by updating tools.nrepl dependency to nrepl/nrepl
