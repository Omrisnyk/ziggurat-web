Welcome to the ziggurat wiki!

Ziggurat is a framework built to simplify Multi-Stream processing on Kafka. It can be used to create a full-fledged Clojure app that reads and processes messages from Kafka.
Ziggurat is built with the intent to abstract out
```
- reading messages from Kafka
- retrying failed messages
- setting up an HTTP server
```
from a clojure application such that a user only needs to pass a function that will be mapped to every message recieved from Kafka.
